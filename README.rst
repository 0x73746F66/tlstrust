Trust Stores
============

Only the following are distinct Root CA Certificate bundles, also
referred to as Trust Stores:

1. Common Certificate Authority Database (CCADB)
2. Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment
3. Google Trust Services
4. Rustls (curated CCADB)
5. libcurl (curated CCADB)
6. Dart Native (curated CCADB)
7. Certifi (curated CCADB)
8. MinTsifry Rossii

Others may exist so please inform us of any we don't already track.

There are many contexts that rely on one of the above, including
Microsoft, Apple, Linux, and Mozilla that all rely on CCADB directly.

Python module usage
===================

In your app you can:

.. code:: py

   import os
   from pathlib import Path
   from OpenSSL.crypto import FILETYPE_ASN1
   from tlstrust import TrustStore
   from tlstrust.context import PLATFORM_JAVA

   der = Path(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "cert.der")).read_bytes()
   trust_store = TrustStore(FILETYPE_ASN1, der)
   assert trust_store.check_trust()
   assert trust_store.check_trust(PLATFORM_JAVA)

`Change Log <https://gitlab.com/trivialsec/tlstrust/-/blob/main/docs/z.change-log.md>`__
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Platform Specific evaluations of trust
======================================

While ``tlstrust`` is a tool for evaluations of trust where certificates
are presented for HTTPS/TLS use, i.e. generally considered the
certificate will be used for web browsers.

There is an explosion of microservice architectures where one endpoint
acts in usual place of a web browser using code, where these programming
languages **never** implement or offer the means to verify trust unless
the developer, each and every time an they code any TLS usage,
explicitly interrogates the full certificate chain and evaluates trust
(which is inevitably not performed).

With the rise of Zero-Trust architectures, where trust must be given
only after verification assurances are gained, the TLS Certificate chain
validation on each endpoint must critically apply suitable evaluation of
the entire Certificate chain. Lacking these evaluations a Zero-Trust
architecture inherently trusts the issued certificates and never
verifies if they are trust-'worthy'. This is the sad state in many
Zero-Trust architectures, a consistent finding in penetration testing
reports completed by competent testers who routinely forge certificates
to by-pass Certificate-based Authentication mechanisms common in
Zero-Trust architectures.

For this reason ``tlstrust`` can be used to perform platform specific
evaluations for common platforms where Zero-Trust architectures operate
in addition to the typical Web Browser checks.

Apple (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS)
---------------------------------------------

`Coming into effect December 1,
2021 <https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/ca_program.html>`__
Apple will use Common CA Certificate Database (CCADB) and enforced April
1, 2022.

For this reason ``tlstrust`` will derive it's result from evaluations of
trust for Apple evaluations using the Common CA Certificate Database
(CCADB).

Windows
-------

`Microsoft Trusted Root
Program <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/participants-list>`__
has fully transitioned to Common CA Certificate Database (CCADB)

Java
----

Planned support of
``/usr/share/ca-certificates-java/ca-certificates-java.jar`` on the
system where ``tlstrust`` is run.

Debian Linux (Including derivatives like Ubuntu)
------------------------------------------------

Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
------------------------------

Open SUSE Linux
---------------

Alpine Linux (Common for container based images)
------------------------------------------------

Arch Linux
----------

These Linux distributions typically include a package named
``update-ca-certificates`` or similar and stored to ``/etc/ssl/certs``,
``/usr/share/ca-certificates``, and
``/usr/local/share/ca-certificates``, or will require developers to
install their own packages that supply a bundle of CA certificates that
are used as the root trust store by most HTTP clients in software and
programming languages.

Some clients behave specific to an installed package called ``openssl``,
or more specifically will use the same default
``/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem`` that is used by ``openssl``.

There are alternatives to the main ``openssl`` package such as
``glib-openssl`` that will use the same common path as ``openssl`` to
store it's own bundle; ``/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem``.

For the purposes of evaluating trust for the Linux platform,
``tlstrust`` will embed the latest signatures from the ``deb``
distribution of ``update-ca-certificates`` combined with the ``openssl``
default. As different versions of any package may install any assortment
of CA certificates in ``/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem``, when evaluating
platform trust for Linux ``tlstrust`` will embed the contents after an
installation of the main ``openssl`` package and
`latest <https://www.openssl.org/source/>`__ Long Term Support (LTS)
version.

Essentially; The results of Linux evaluation will be based on the latest
Debian bundle and the default bundle of LTS ``openssl`` that will be
present in any up-to-date distribution.

Evaluations of trust for Web Browsers
=====================================

The approach for all participating browsers will soon be standardized on
the Common CA Certificate Database (CCADB).

Below is a pseudo knowledge base to help guide users of how results of
using ``tlstrust`` are derived:

Firefox
-------

All evaluations of trust for Firefox will derive it's result using the
Common CA Certificate Database (CCADB)

Tor Browser
-----------

Firefox; All evaluations of trust for Firefox will derive it's result
using the Common CA Certificate Database (CCADB)

Chromium Web Browser
--------------------

`Chrome Root
Program <https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy>`__
as at Oct 2021 is in a transitional state, both the platform/operating
system root trust store and the platform independent (and consistent
across participating browsers) are both supported.

For this reason ``tlstrust`` will derive it's result from evaluations of
trust for Chrome using the Common CA Certificate Database (CCADB).

Google Chrome
-------------

Microsoft Edge
--------------

Brave
-----

Opera
-----

Vivaldi
-------

Amazon Silk
-----------

Samsung Internet Browser
------------------------

Yandex Browser
--------------

Chromium-based; All evaluations of trust for Firefox will derive it's
result using the Common CA Certificate Database (CCADB)

Safari
------

The `macOS Trust Store <https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202858>`__
contained trusted root certificates that are preinstalled with macOS and
used by Safari.

The `iOS Trust Store <https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204132>`__
contained trusted root certificates that are preinstalled with iOS and
used by all web browsers that run on iOS (there are no exceptions, Apple
simply do not allow any other browsers or overrides of critical
features, such as root trust, on the iOS platform)

`Coming into effect December 1,
2021 <https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/ca_program.html>`__
Apple will also use Common CA Certificate Database (CCADB) which will be
enforced and used solely from April 1, 2022.

For this reason ``tlstrust`` will derive it's result from evaluations of
trust for Safari evaluations using the Common CA Certificate Database
(CCADB).

Programming Language Trust (Microservice architecture and APIs)
===============================================================

Starting with Python

.. _python-native-httpclient:

Python native ``http.client``
-----------------------------

There are no Root CA Certificates that are trusted by default, it relies
on ``ssl.SSLContext`` (or ``ssl.create_default_context``) to be provided
to the ``HTTPSConnection`` when TLS verification is used.

Therefore the methodology would be via
```SSLContext.load_default_certs()`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext.load_default_certs>`__
which ``tlstrust`` also needs to be asked which server Python is running
on. Therefore native Python can be checked using:

Python package ``certifi``
--------------------------

Many Python packages (like ``pyOpenSSL`` that ``tlstrust`` uses)
leverage a package called ``certifi`` for a consistent root trust
evaluation across platforms.

While ``certifi`` is commonly believed to make the Mozilla Root CA Trust
Store available to python, which it does, but ``certifi`` is it's own
Root CA Trust Store because they further curate the Certificates to
explicitly not trust any weak Certificates - and unfortunately suffers
from being out-of-sync with updates to the Mozilla Root CA Trust Store.

Python package ``urllib``
-------------------------

Many Python popular packages (like ``requests`` where ``certifi``
originated) leverage a package called ``urllib`` for as common http
client, and add a better developer experience on top.

While ``urllib`` is commonly believed to do it's own Root CA Trust Store
checking, it actually uses ``certifi`` so ``tlstrust`` will alias
``context.PYTHON_URLLIB`` to ``context.PYTHON_CERTIFI`` until such a
time this changes.

Python package ``requests``
---------------------------

The most popular package in python is ``requests``.

Under ``requests`` is ``urllib`` for making HTTP clients, which in turn
uses ``certifi`` for its Root CA Trust Store checking, So ``tlstrust``
will alias ``context.PYTHON_REQUESTS`` to ``context.PYTHON_URLLIB``
until such a time this changes.

Python framework ``django``
---------------------------

The most popular framework in python is ``django``.

Similiar to ``requests``; Under ``django`` is ``urllib`` for making HTTP
clients, which in turn uses ``certifi`` for its Root CA Trust Store
checking, So ``tlstrust`` will alias ``context.PYTHON_DJANGO`` to
``context.PYTHON_URLLIB`` until such a time this changes.
